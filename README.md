# ROAD TRIP!

Have you ever wanted to live vicariously through Robert de Forest? Your time
has come!  He's going to [Get On His Bad Motor Scooter And
Ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk52nGxF-jc), and he's documenting the
process here.

# The plan

Many have already heard the exciting news: in March of 2018 Robert decided to
go on a road trip on his motorcycle. He will post a detailed plan elsewhere in
this project space, but the short version goes, a little something ..  _uh
like **this**_:

- 2-4 weeks
 - move someone else into my place to get out of lease-breaking terms
 - find safe places for irreplaceable stuff I want to keep and deliver stuff to those places as checked baggage when I visit said places
 - give away irreplaceable stuff I don't want to keep
 - throw out replaceable stuff nobody wants
- 1-2 weeks
 - "short" motorcycle rides around the Pacific North West to make sure my bike and I are ready for this and to address any surprises.
- thenceforth
 - Too  Hot   : ride North
 - Too  Cold  : ride South
 - Just Right : ride East
 - Reached the Atlantic : repeat with East/West swapped

# Some particulars

- It is possible I will wander into Canada in the summer or Mexico in the
  winter. That's fine.
 
- I'm looking forward to seeing lots of non-Seattle folks in person over the
  course of the trip.

- I will publish updates in this GitHub repository. If you want to subscribe
  to updates point your news reader (I use InoReader) at
  [this feed](https://github.com/thatsnice/road-trip/commits/master.atom).

- If you want to plan for me to visit you, one option is to file an Issue
  against this project. "Bug: not enough Robert in my town!"

- I hope/plan to publish my location and some GoPro video both for safety and
  the amusement of whoever really does want to live vicariously through me. If
  I stop updating and my location stops changing, maybe something happened to
  me? Let's hope it's something good?

# What's in it for you?

- See the country, and possibly the world if I decide to head into Canada or Mexico!
- File bug reports about how I don't have enough representation of your favorite thing!
- Make fun of my aversion to risk as demonstrated by my contradictory
  preference for less-busy throughfairs where I might not be found until too
  late if I have an accident!
